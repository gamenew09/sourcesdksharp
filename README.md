# SourceSDK Sharp

A source engine mod that creates a link between the C++ game code and C# (Mono) that is based upon this fork of Source SDK 2013: https://github.com/benpye/source-mono-2013

This is nowhere near complete, and it will not be as secure as something like Garry's Mod at least at the start.

## Compiling

Currently there is no instructions, will be updating the Readme with instructions soon.
